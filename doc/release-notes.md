Notable changes
===============

Change to Transaction Relay Policy
----------------------------------

Transactions paying less than the [ZIP 317](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0317)
conventional fee to the extent that they have more than `-txunpaidactionlimit`
unpaid actions (default: 50) will not be accepted to the mempool or relayed.
For the default values of `-txunpaidactionlimit` and `-blockunpaidactionlimit`,
these transactions would never be mined by the ZIP 317 block construction
algorithm. (If the transaction has been prioritised by `prioritisetransaction`,
the modified fee is used to calculate the number of unpaid actions.)

Removal of Fee Estimation
-------------------------

The `estimatefee` RPC call, which estimated the fee needed for a transaction to
be included within a target number of blocks, has been removed. The fee that
should be paid under normal circumstances is the ZIP 317 conventional fee; it
is not possible to compute that without knowing the number of logical actions
in a transaction, which was not an input to `estimatefee`. The `fee_estimates.dat`
file is no longer used.

Privacy Policy Changes
----------------------

 The `AllowRevealedSenders` privacy policy no longer allows sending from
 multiple taddrs in the same transaction. This now requires
 `AllowLinkingAccountAddresses`. Care should be taken in using
 `AllowLinkingAccountAddresses` too broadly, as it can also result in linking
 UAs when transparent funds are sent from them. The practical effect is that an
 explicit privacy policy is always required for `z_mergetoaddress`,
`z_sendmany`, and `z_shieldcoinbase` when sending from multiple taddrs, even
when using wildcards like `*` and `ANY_TADDR`.

Platform Support
----------------

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS has been removed from the list of supported platforms. It
  reached End of Support on May 31st 2023, and no longer satisfies our Tier 2
  policy requirements.

Python Support
--------------

Support for Python 2 has been discontinued for all test files and tools.
