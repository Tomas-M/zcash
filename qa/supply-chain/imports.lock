https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/security/rule-of-2.md#unsafe-code-in-safe-languages

This crate will not introduce a serious security vulnerability to production
software exposed to untrusted input.

Auditors are not required to perform a full logic review of the entire crate.
Rather, they must review enough to fully reason about the behavior of all unsafe
blocks and usage of powerful imports. For any reasonable usage of the crate in
real-world software, an attacker must not be able to manipulate the runtime
behavior of these sections in an exploitable or surprising way.

Ideally, ambient capabilities (e.g. filesystem access) are hardened against
manipulation and consistent with the advertised behavior of the crate. However,
some discretion is permitted. In such cases, the nature of the discretion should
be recorded in the `notes` field of the audit record.

Any unsafe code in this crate must, in general, be kept well-contained, and
documentation must exist to describe how Rust's invariants are being upheld
despite the unsafe block(s). Nontrivial uses of unsafe must be reviewed by an
expert in Rust's unsafety guarantees/non-guarantees.

For crates which generate deployed code (e.g. build dependencies or procedural
macros), reasonable usage of the crate should output code which meets the above

`proc-macro2` acts as either a thin(-ish) wrapper around the std-provided
`proc_macro` crate, or as a fallback implementation of the crate, depending on
where it is used.

If using this crate on older versions of rustc (1.56 and earlier), it will
temporarily replace the panic handler while initializing in order to detect if
it is running within a `proc_macro`, which could lead to surprising behaviour.
This should not be an issue for more recent compiler versions, which support
`proc_macro::is_available()`.

The `proc-macro2` crate's fallback behaviour is not identical to the complex
behaviour of the rustc compiler (e.g. it does not perform unicode normalization
for identifiers), however it behaves well enough for its intended use-case
(tests and scripts processing rust code).

`proc-macro2` does not use unsafe code, however exposes one `unsafe` API to
allow bypassing checks in the fallback implementation when constructing
`Literal` using `from_str_unchecked`. This was intended to only be used by the
`quote!` macro, however it has been removed
(https://github.com/dtolnay/quote/commit/f621fe64a8a501cae8e95ebd6848e637bbc79078),
